{"name":"CSS3 Generator","tagline":"A simple, responsive CSS3 generator built with Foundation Framework, jQuery UI, and just a little love.","body":"## About\r\nThis project is an overdue attempt to create a tool that I would use in my own front end process. There is currently no shortage of \"CSS3\" syntax generators -- and their usefulness has declined significantly with the celebrated shedding of several vendor prefixes. Still, creating a generator has long been near the top of my to-do list and, if nothing else, I thought it would be a good exercise in the following:\r\n\r\n1. Cranking out a JS project quickly and efficiently\r\n2. Developing on my shiny new Chromebook\r\n3. Using Git and GitHub to manage and share my code\r\n\r\nWith those items in mind I feel this has been a success. I have some non-critical wishlist goals that I still plan to address, so this certainly isn't 100% complete. I also plan at some point to spruce up the look of things, as it's currently just a stock Foundation layout with bland colors (on the bright side, it's not distracting).\r\n\r\n## To-Do\r\nNon-critical but valuable and planned:\r\n\r\n1. Add optional RGBA input where now only HEX is offered\r\n2. Add color picker for color inputs\r\n3. Consider stacked layout for right two columns\r\n4. Add more properties","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
