<p>This project is an overdue attempt to create a tool that I would use in my own front end process. There is currently no shortage of "CSS3" syntax generators -- and their usefulness has declined significantly with the celebrated shedding of several vendor prefixes. Still, creating a generator has long been near the top of my to-do list and, if nothing else, I thought it would be a good exercise in the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cranking out a JS project quickly and efficiently</li>
<li>Developing on my shiny new Chromebook</li>
<li>Using Git and GitHub to manage and share my code</li>
</ol><p>With those items in mind I feel this has been a success. I have some non-critical wishlist goals that I still plan to address, so this certainly isn't 100% complete. I also plan at some point to spruce up the look of things, as it's currently just a stock Foundation layout with bland colors (on the bright side, it's not distracting).</p>

<h2>
<a name="to-do" class="anchor" href="#to-do"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To-Do</h2>

<p>Non-critical but valuable and planned:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add optional RGBA input where now only HEX is offered</li>
<li>Add color picker for color inputs</li>
<li>Consider stacked layout for right two columns</li>
<li>Add more properties</li>
</ol>
