CSS3 Generator
=======

A simple, responsive CSS3 generator built with Foundation Framework, jQuery UI, and just a little love.

[Working generator here](http://jerstew.github.io/css3gen). Brief project description [here](http://jerstew.github.io/css3gen/about.html "project page"). Built over approximately two weeks of intermittent progress and lots of picking.

##To-Do
1. Add optional RGBA input where now only HEX is offered
2. Add color picker for color inputs
3. Consider stacked layout for right two columns
4. Add more properties
5. Copy to clipboard!

##Inspiration
[CSS3 Generator](http://css3generator.com/) by [Randy Jensen](http://www.randyjensen.com/). One of my most visited tools over the past couple of years. Insanely valuable and recently redesigned.

##Contribute
Please do. I'm by no means a JavaScript pro. This project is mostly about learning and having fun, so I would appreciate any suggestions, additions, or corrections.

##License
CSS3 Generator is available under the **MIT license**. See the LICENSE file for more information.
